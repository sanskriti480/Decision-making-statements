Experiment 5

Aim - To study and implement C++ decision making statements.

Apparatus - VS Code or Programiz Online C++ Compiler.

Theory - 

Program 1
This C++ program is used to check whether a number entered by the user is even or odd. It first asks the user to input any number, which is stored in the variable num. Then, it uses an if-else condition to check
whether the number is divisible by 2 using the modulus operator %. If num % 2 is equal to 0, it means there is no remainder when divided by 2, so the number is even. Otherwise, the number is odd. This program
helps beginners understand how to use conditional statements and the modulus operator to solve simple mathematical problems in C++.

Program 2
This C++ program is used to find out which of the three numbers entered by the user is the greatest. It asks the user to input three numbers: num1, num2, and num3. Then, using a set of if-else conditions, the
program compares the numbers to decide which one is the largest. It checks various possibilities—whether num1 is greater than the others, or num2, or num3. It also tries to handle special cases like when two or all
three numbers are equal.

Program 3
This C++ program is used to check whether the alphabet entered by the user is a vowel or a consonant. It starts by asking the user to input a single character (a letter), which is stored in the variable alphabet.
Then, using an if-else condition, it checks whether the entered letter is one of the five vowels: A, E, I, O, or U (either in uppercase or lowercase). If it matches any of these, the program prints “It is a
vowel!!”. If it doesn't match any vowel, the program assumes it's a consonant and prints “It is a consonant!!”. This code helps beginners understand how to use logical OR (||) operators to check multiple conditions
and how to work with character input in C++. 

Program 4
This C++ program is a simple calculator that performs one of four operations based on the user’s choice: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The user is asked to enter two numbers and then choose
an operation using a number from 1 to 4. The switch statement is used to perform the selected operation. For each case, the corresponding arithmetic operation is done and the result is displayed. In the division
case, the program also checks whether the second number is zero to avoid division by zero, which is not allowed in math. This program helps learners understand how to use switch-case statements, arithmetic
operators, and input/output operations in a clean and interactive way.

Program 5
The user is asked to enter a number from 1 to 7, where each number represents a day of the week (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, and so on). Based on the number entered, the program prints the corresponding day
along with an encouraging or fun message to brighten the user’s mood. If the user enters a number outside the range of 1 to 7, the program responds with “Enter a valid choice!!” to guide them. This program helps
learners understand how to use switch-case structures for decision-making.

Conclusion - I learned the use of switch case and conditional statements(if-else) to imlplement and execute the codes.
